# React Side Projects Collection

Welcome to my React Side Projects repository! 🚀

## 🎯 Motive

The goal of this repository is to document my journey in mastering React and modern frontend development. It serves as a centralized collection of various side projects, experiments, and UI implementations.

By consolidating these projects here, I aim to:
- Showcase different React patterns and best practices.
- Experiment with new libraries and tools (like Vite, Tailwind CSS, etc.).
- Build a portfolio of functional and responsive web applications.
- Track my progress and improvements over time.

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository will grow to include multiple independent projects. Currently, it contains:

### 1. [React User List](./React%20User-List)
A responsive web application that displays a grid of professional user profiles.
- **Key Features**: Responsive grid layout, detailed profile cards, availability status, and skill tags.
- **Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
- **Location**: [`/React User-List`](./React%20User-List) (Check this folder for project-specific documentation and installation instructions).

## 🔮 What's Next?

I will be adding more React projects to this repository in the future. Expect to see:
- Interactive forms and validation.
- State management experiments (Redux, Context API).
- API integrations and data fetching.
- Custom hooks and component libraries.
